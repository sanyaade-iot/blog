Sting's particular magic is that it glows blue whenever orcs or goblins are nearby. This is useful for hobbits, but in today's day and age, a real Sting would be unfortunately boring.

To celebrate the launch of the new *Hobbit* flick, we made a version of Sting that turns blue near unsecured Wi-Fi networks. And when you slash the sword, Sting will jump on the network, and publish a message: "{YOUR WI-FI NETWORK} has been conquered!"

## Step 1: the ingredients

To make your own WarSting, you'll need two things: a [toy Sting](http://www.amazon.com/The-Bridge-Direct-Hobbit-Deluxe/dp/B008914XZA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1417654336&sr=8-2&keywords=sting+sword), and a [Spark Core](https://store.spark.io).
