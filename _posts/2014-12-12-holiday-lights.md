Happy Holidays from Spark!

Last week many of us Sparklers met in person for the first time at our first big holiday party and hackathon!
It was awesome, and we'll be posting more fun projects from the hackathon soon.  In decorating for the party, Christine
insisted the tree be internet connected, and so we excitedly set off to work.  Here's what we built:


Internet connected cheer lights and buttons!
----------

Since it was a party, the lights needed to be something that would engage everyone and be interactive.  
We had plenty Spark Cores, so naturally the decorations could react to input from anywhere in the world.
But what should we use as input? If only there were something worldwide, something contagious, something appropriate for the season.
But of course!  They would be powered by, and generate Holiday Cheer.

I hope if you're reading this that you're feeling inspired to make your own Holiday Cheer system!  Jump over to the <a href="http://www.hackster.io/middleca/holiday-cheer-lights">Holiday Cheer Lights build post to read more about how we put it together.</a>

Happy Holidays!
